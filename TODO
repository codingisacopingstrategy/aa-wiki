High priority
=============

- Skip tag
- Create new page: default content that give clues
    - First page directly created?
    - Give a location to the first annotation
    - add annotation button: predefined location + meaningful text too.
* Improve history 
    * Be able to revert a page
- layer palette doesn't refresh


Low priority
============

- BUG: negative positions
- bug with column ":" in url: sould be escaped by the wikify function.
- shift to enable the grid snapping
- javascript scrollbars (less ugly)
- draggable help
- extra menu to show/hide annotation by criterias
- Metadata in the sidebar
- edit locks?
- button to remove the about attribute/ drag the @ to remove the about attribute + confirmation
- "attach" boxes
    - with data-anchor, data-position (north, south, east, west etc.)
- configure serve to serve best html5 video/audio
- RSS feeds
- Still a problem with non consecutive header levels...
- list pages filter ?

Ideas
=====

- html5 audio/video: preload="auto"?
- How can RDF be useful for collective commenting and annotating?
- rdf metadata to create relation between pages. EG. translation.
- move page
- How to preserve the title attribute with the new syntax ([[embed::ressource]])?
- manual sectioning "8<---"? What about the <br /> tag which is semantically correct for this?
- Notion of focus for media, to know which one is being controlled
- different types of landmarks... what syntax?

Oralsite workshop remarks
=========================

- video leads text/text leads video
- embed webpages = iframe?

- A nice sniffer: `file`:

    ➜  ~  file /tmp/marqueurs.txt    
    /tmp/marqueurs.txt: ASCII English text, with very long lines

- annotation negative position happens when one rescales the annotation "outside" the screen.
- manual to update
- how to change the embed wrapper?
