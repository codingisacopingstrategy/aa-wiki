# How can I embed an RSS feed?

Create a link to the feed with an embed relation, like this:

    [[ embed::http://url/of/the/rss/feed.rss ]]

# How can I put an image in the background?

Because Active Archives wiki syntax is based on Markdown, it is possible to use
plain HTML in your documents, including css directives. If you want to put an
image in the background of your page you can put somewhere in the source of the
page the following snippet:

    <style>
    body {
        background: url('http://repo.oralsite.stdin.fr/Jerome%20Bel/Jerome%20Bel_show_wrk_01.jpg');
        -moz-background-size: auto 100%; /* Firefox 3.6 */
        background-size: auto 100%;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position:center;
    }
    </style>
